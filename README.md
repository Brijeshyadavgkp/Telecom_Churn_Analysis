# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction - High-Value Customers

In the highly competitive telecom industry, customer churn represents a major challenge as customers often switch between service providers, leading to an annual churn rate of 15-25%. Given that acquiring a new customer costs 5-10 times more than retaining an existing one, customer retention has become essential, especially for highly profitable segments. This project focuses on predicting customer churn for high-value prepaid customers, specifically within the Indian and Southeast Asian markets.
Project Overview

This project leverages customer-level data from a leading telecom firm to identify high-risk customers for churn among high-value prepaid users. We aim to build predictive models to pinpoint those at risk of churn and highlight key indicators that signal churn. The primary goals are:

    Churn Prediction: Predict customers at high risk of leaving the service provider.
    Identifying Indicators: Determine the main factors contributing to customer churn to help inform retention strategies.

Defining Churn

The term "churn" can vary based on customer payment models and service usage patterns:

    Postpaid Customers: Churn is straightforward, as customers typically inform the provider before switching.
    Prepaid Customers: Churn is harder to detect as customers can simply stop using services without notification.

Churn Definition for This Project

This project focuses on a usage-based definition of churn, where customers are considered to have churned if they show no incoming or outgoing usage over a specific period. This approach aligns with the prepaid market dynamics in India and Southeast Asia, where prepaid is the predominant payment model.
High-Value Customers

High-value customers generate around 80% of revenue, making them a key focus for retention. This project will:

    Define high-value customers based on a specific metric.
    Predict churn exclusively among this customer segment to minimize revenue leakage effectively.

Key Project Steps

    Data Preprocessing: Prepare and clean customer data for analysis.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify patterns and key insights related to churn.
    Feature Engineering: Create relevant features to enhance predictive modeling.
    Model Building: Develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict churn.
    Churn Indicators Identification: Determine the main factors that contribute to customer churn.

Technologies

    Python for data analysis and model building.
    Machine Learning libraries like scikit-learn for model training and evaluation.
    Data Visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for insights.

Outcome

This project will provide insights and predictive capabilities to help telecom operators proactively retain high-value prepaid customers, ultimately reducing churn rates and protecting revenue.
